# My-Portfolio

My name is Ruth Mutanga and this is My Portfolio.

this portfolio website has been created with html and css skills taught as part of the Engineering Immersion prep course with Thinkfull. For my html I used the
semantic containers like main, article, and footer.
I styled links using pseudo-classes.
I used comments throughout my HTML and CSS that explained my code.
